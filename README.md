# FCC-Javascript-Algorithm-Projects
This is a repo that contains my original solutions for FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithm Projects.

Disclaimer: These solutions were posted in April 2019. If you are viewing these solutions in the future, be warned that many of them are not completely performance optimized and they also may not be an accurate reflection of my current abilities as a developer.
